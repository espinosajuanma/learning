# `tmux` - Use `Ctrl+B` and `t` to display time

I didn't know about this one. I was casually reading the man page of
tmux and I was curious in some key bindings that I wasn't aware of.

I think it is a cool "screen-saver" when I am afk or even to show the
time to someone.

- `Ctrl+B` + `t` - Show the time
