# Use `ln -s [path] [path]` to make a symbolic link file

```bash
ln -s /scripts/todo /scripts/doto
```

I already knew this, but once in a while I forget the command because I
don't use it often.

I use it to have several scripts that does the same but have different
configurations for each one. If I update the code of one, it will keep
the code updated as they are linked.

I would like to know more about links between files too.

To check the list of files and see links use `ls -l`
