# `tmux` - Use `Ctrl+B` and `N` or `P` to go next/previous window

This keybinding is great. I am usually switching between windows with
numbers, which made me have a nice organization of them.

But it may be useful this ones and maybe map them to something more
easier to work with and integrate with my workflow.

- `Ctrl+B` and `N` - Travel to the next window
- `Ctrl+B` and `P` - Travel to the previous window
