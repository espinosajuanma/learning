# `tmux` - Use `Ctrl+B` and `(` or `)` to go next/previous session

Additionally to next and previous window I can use this keybindings to
my road of integrating also sessions on my workflow.

It may be good to remap too.

- `Ctrl+B` and `(` - Switch to the previous session
- `Ctrl+B` and `)` - Switch to next session
