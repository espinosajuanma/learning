# Use `{` and `}` to move above/below paragraphs

I was using just `j` and `k` for vertical movement with `gg` and `G` to
travel at top and bottom of document.

But if I want to move the cursor to another paragraph quicker I should
use `{` that moves above the paragraph and `}` that do the opposite.
