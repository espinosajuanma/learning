# Use `caw` to change all word

I was used to use `cw` to change a word. This is nice but I have to move
the cursor at the beginning of the word, that I can easily do with `b`.

But there is another nice binding that is `caw` that can be vocalized
like *«Change all word»*. This is another nice way, instead `bcw`.
