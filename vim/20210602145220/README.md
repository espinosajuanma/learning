# Use `0` and `$` moving from start and end of line

I am used to press `Home` and `End` keys for this. But if I want to use
them for vim functions I had to start using them.

- `0` go to start of line
- `$` go to end of line

Things like `d0` that cut everything from cursor position to start of
line.
