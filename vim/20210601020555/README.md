# Use `yy` (yank) and `p` or `P` to copy and paste lines

If I want to copy a line I would use `yy` to copy and then `p` to paste
it.

If I want to copy 3 lines I use `3yy` and then `p`

Paste is relative to the cursor. It will paste one line below it.
Instead if I want to copy that lines above I would use `P` not `p`.
