# Upper/Lower case using `gu`, `gU` and `g~`

Suppose you have a big chunk of text with uppercase letters and you have
to transform to lowercase. Use `gu` and direction to that. If you need
the opposite use `gU` and direction.

- `gu` - To lowercase
- `gU` - To uppercase
- `g~` - Toggle upper to lower and vice versa
