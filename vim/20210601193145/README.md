# Use `q` to macro start/stop and `@` to execute it

Macros are really useful to repeat N times a task or a series of keys.

## Steps

- Start recording with `q`
- Give a key to «name» this macro (like `a`)
- Do whatever need to record
- Stop recording with `q` again

Then to execute that macro use `@a` or whatever letter was used to save
it.

Repeat the macro 100 times using `100@a`
