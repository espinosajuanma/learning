# Using mysql on terminal

In class they insist to use MySQL Workbench that isn't a bad tool. But
in my way to keep using as much as I can the terminal I find the way to
use mysql using «command prompt» on windows. I will learn how to do it
on linux other day.

- Installed MySQL 8.0
- Added `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Shell 8.0\bin` in my path
  environment variables
- Then used the command `mysql -uroot -p`
