# Use `git add -p` to stage chunks

This flag is useful you made several changes to a file and you want to
separate those changes in different commits.

```sh
git add -p
```

Git is going to ask you interactively to choose chunks of the file you
edited. You can select which changes you want to stage and which you
don't.
